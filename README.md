Neural Net (in Ruby)
===

A [feedforward neural network](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network) with [resilient backpropagation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rprop) (Rprop). It's ~250 loc, with no external dependencies.

Run ```iris.rb``` to see an example of solving a simple classification problem: predict the species of iris flower based on sepal and petal size.
